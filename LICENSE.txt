Ghost Body Object (GBO) Fair-Source License v2.0
Copyright (c) 2026 Gabriel RABHI. All rights reserved.

1. Preamble
The Ghost Body Object (GBO) technology is designed to revolutionize memory management and distributed systems. This license grants freedom of use to individuals, educators, and small businesses, while requiring large commercial entities who derive value from the Software—whether through external sales or internal efficiency—to contribute to its development.

2. Definitions
"The Software": The GBO source code, binaries, and associated documentation.

"Licensor": Gabriel RABHI.

"Licensee": The individual or legal entity exercising rights under this License. For legal entities, "Licensee" includes any Affiliates.

"Affiliates": Any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Licensee. "Control" means ownership of 50% or more of the shares or voting rights.

"Group Revenue": The total gross annual revenue (or total funding raised, if pre-revenue) of the Licensee and all its Affiliates, calculated on a consolidated basis for the most recent fiscal year.

"Revenue Limit": $2,000,000 USD (Two Million US Dollars).

"Production Use": Using the Software to process live data, serve end-users, support business operations, or for any purpose other than development, testing, and staging.

3. Grant of Rights (Below Revenue Limit)
Subject to the terms of this License, the Licensor grants the Licensee a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, modify, and distribute the Software, provided that the Licensee’s Group Revenue is below the Revenue Limit.

For these users, the rights are functionally equivalent to the Apache License 2.0, including the requirement to preserve copyright notices.

4. Commercial Use (Above Revenue Limit)
If the Licensee’s Group Revenue exceeds the Revenue Limit, the royalty-free grant in Section 3 does not apply to any Production Use.

Mandatory License: To use the Software in a Production Environment, such Licensees must obtain a GBO Commercial License from the Licensor.

Internal Use: This requirement applies regardless of whether the Software is distributed to third parties or used strictly for internal business operations (e.g., internal databases, trading engines, backend processing).

Evaluation: Licensees above the limit may use the Software for Proof of Concept (PoC) or development for a period of 45 days. Continued use beyond this period requires a Commercial License.

5. Restrictions
No Service Wrapping: You may not offer the Software as a standalone "Database-as-a-Service," "Memory-as-a-Service," or similar managed service to third parties without an explicit Partnership Agreement, regardless of revenue.

Circumvention: You may not manipulate corporate structure or financial reporting for the primary purpose of evading the Revenue Limit.

6. Disclaimer
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
